## Description of the images not put in the report

The following images have not been included in the report - 
1. Geographic scatter plots for the following boroughs - Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island. Only the plot for Brooklyn has been included. Similar to the Brooklyn plot, these show the exact locations of the accidents in these boroughs. They have not been included as the plot for Brooklyn, and the bar charts for the accident type by boroughs (Fig 10) were sufficient to infer all that we needed to, and these visualisations felt redundant. They can be found under the task 1 folder of this directory.

2. Time wise plots of the accident numbers, injuries and deaths of the various boroughs. Similar to the previous ones, the borough wise plots follow trends pretty similar to the trends of the entire city, and we could not infer anything new from them, hence they have not been included. They can be found under the task 2 folder of this directory.
